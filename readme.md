# ac;pic :: all your photos and videos in one place

## About

ac;pic is an application that allows you to store and manage your pictures and videos (pivs). ac;pic is built by [Altocode](https://altocode.nl). While the service itself is paid, Altocode freely shares the code for all purposes, including commercial ones.

To understand why we're sharing the source code of a commercial product, please read [our manifesto](http://federicopereiro.com/manifesto). If that's too long to read, in a nutshell: we want to share our code so that others can learn from it and contribute to us. Sharing is the way to progress.

All non-code documents related to the project are published in this [open folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/11UPZHrHUT_ce2baN9s0K-CtfXYQOewG3).

## Status

ac;pic is currently in private beta.

The authors wish to thank [Browserstack](https://browserstack.com) for providing tools to test cross-browser compatibility.

## Functionality

### Core functions

1. **Upload**. Converse operation are **delete** and **import**.
2. **Tag**. Converse operation is **untag**. Complementary operation are **rotate** and **enable/disable geotagging**.
3. **Share**. Converse operation is **unshare**. Complementary operations are **accepting a shared tag** and **deleting a shared tag**.
4. **See**. No converse operation. Complementary operation is **download**.

Functions 1 through 3 modify the data; the last function is purely passive.

### Complementary functions

1. **Auth**.
2. **Account**. Complementary functions are **export** and **import**.
3. **Payment**.

## Security

If you find a security vulnerability, please disclose it to us as soon as possible (`info AT altocode.nl`). We'll work on it with the utmost priority.

### Already implemented

- Pivs
   - Show onboarding if the user hasn't tagged any pivs yet, but not if the user arrives to the app with a link to a query. When clicking on any tag, go to grid view.
   - Show home tags when entering to the app. When clicking on any tag, go to grid view.
   - When coming back to the pics view from another view, always show home tags.
   - Show dialog that indicates that a click selects a piv and that a double click opens it. The dialog should be permanently dismissable.
   - Show all pivs.
   - Show pivs split in meaningful chunks.
   - Load more pivs on scroll.
   - Hide unseen chunks so that performance remains the same no matter how deeply you scroll.
   - Sort by newest, oldest & upload date.
   - Select/unselect piv by clicking on it.
   - Multiple selection with shift.
   - Select/unselect all.
   - On top, have an always visible bar that shows the dates of the pivs you are seeing, as well as the total number of pivs, the number of selected pivs (if any) and the selected tags (if any).
   - When selecting pivs, see selection bar.
   - Hover on piv and see date.
   - Show untagged pivs.
   - Show year tags.
   - Show only one year tag if one is selected.
   - Show month tags only when a year tag is selected. When a month tag is selected, show the other available months as selectable and remove the current month if another month is selected.
   - When a year tag is removed from the query, also remove the month tag.
   - When all tags are removed from the current query and there is a selection, remove the selection.
   - When querying untagged tag, remove non-year and non-geo tags. When querying normal tag, remove untagged tag.
   - When modifying pivs with `untagged` in the query, add button for confirming operation ("Mark As Organized"); show alert if user navigates away.
   - See list of tags.
   - Query by tag or tags.
   - Show pivs according to the selected tags.
   - If there are selected pivs, toggle between browse mode & organize mode.
   - If query changes but selected pivs are still there, maintain their selection.
   - When performing changes to pivs, if that results on a query with no pivs, the query will be resetted to show Everything.
   - Filter tags when browsing.
   - Tag/untag.
   - Allow to mark pivs as Organized or as To Organize.
   - For a given query, if the query includes Organized or To Organize, see the total number of pivs for the complement tag (for example: if `'o::'` is in the query, see the number of pivs To Organize that the query would have *without* `'o::'`).
   - Filter tags when tagging/untagging.
   - Rotate pivs.
   - Delete pivs.
   - Ignore rotation of videos.
   - When clicking on tag on the attach/unattach menu, remove selection and query the tag.
   - When untagging, if no pivs left with that tag, remove tag from query. Same goes for marking as Organized if To Organize is in the query, or if marking as To Organize if Organized is in the query.
   - Fill pivs grid until screen is full or no pivs remain.
   - Block selection of a tag if the UI is still processing a previous selection of a tag.
   - Download a single piv.
   - Download multiple pivs as one zip file. The original modification times of each file should be respected.
   - Only show tags relevant to the current query.
   - When just enabling geotagging, update tags every 3 seconds.
   - Suggest geotagging when having a few pivs uploaded, but only once; either enable it or dismiss the message, and don't show it again.
   - When clicking on no man's land, unselect.
   - When querying untagged pivs AND pivs are selected, show "Done tagging" button. When tagging those pivs, they remain in selection until either 1) "Done tagging" button is clicked; 2) all pivs are unselected; or 3) "untagged" is removed from query.
   - Scroll to the top of the pivs grid when selecting a new combination of tags.
   - Retain current query and scroll position in the URL, so it can be copied and opened into a new tab.
   - The back button takes you to the previous query (including its scroll position), but not to the same query with a different scroll position.
   - When scrolling up/down, updates should not modify the scroll position.
   - When uploads are happening in the background that affect the current query, the piv at the top left of the screen should remain on the top row until the next refresh.
   - When uploads are happening in the background that affect the current query, show a dialog that allows for the query to be manually updated, or auto-updated.
   - Be able to invert the order in which tags on the left sidebar are shown, as well as sorting alphabetically rather than by number of pivs.
   - Click on chunk header to narrow down selection (range tag).

## Server

General server approach outlined [here](https://github.com/fpereiro/backendlore).

### Routes

If any route fails with an internal error, a 500 code will be returned with body `{error: ...}`.

All `POST` requests must have a `content-type` header of `application/json` and their bodies must be valid JSON objects. The only exception is `POST /piv`, which must be of type `multipart/form-data`.

All non-auth routes (unless marked otherwise) will respond with a 403 error with body `{error: 'nocookie'}` if the user is not logged in.

If a cookie with invalid signature is sent along, the application will respond with a 403 error with body `{error: 'tampered'}`.

If a cookie with valid signature but that has already expired is sent along, the application will respond with a 403 error with body `{error: 'session'}`.

All POST requests (unless marked otherwise) must contain a `csrf` field equivalent to the `csrf` provided by a successfull call to `POST /auth/login`. This requirement is for CSRF prevention. In the case of `POST /piv`, the `csrf` field must be present as a field within the `multipart/form-data` form. If this condition is not met, a 403 error will be sent.

#### Request invite

- `POST /requestInvite`.
   - Body must be `{email: STRING}`, otherwise a 400 will be sent.

#### Auth routes

- `GET /auth/csrf`.
   - If the user is not logged in or the session expired, returns a 403.
   - Otherwise, returns a body `{csrf: STRING}`, where `STRING` is the CSRF token to be used in all requests.

- `POST /auth/login`.
   - Does not require the user to be logged in.
   - Body must be `{username: STRING, password: STRING, timezone: INTEGER}`. If not, a 400 code will be returned with body `{error: ...}`.
   - `username` is lowercased and any leading & trailing space is removed from it (and intermediate spaces or space-like characters are reduced to a single space). `username` can be either the `username` or the `email` associated to a `username`.
   - If the username/password combination is not valid, a 403 code will be returned with body: `{error: 'auth'}`.
   - If the username/password combination is valid but the email hasn't been verified yet, a 403 code will be returned with body `{error: 'verify'}`.
   - `timezone` must be the output of `Date.getTimezoneOffset ()`, an integer expressing the number of minutes behind (or ahead) of UTC in the local time.

- `POST /auth/signup`.
   - Does not require the user to be logged in.
   - Body must be `{username: STRING, password: STRING, email: STRING, token: STRING}`. The email must be a valid email. If not, a 400 code will be returned with body `{error: ...}`.
   - Both `username` and `email` are lowercased and leading & trailing space is removed from them (and intermediate spaces or space-like characters are reduced to a single space). `username` cannot contain any `@` or `:` characters.
   - The trimmed `username` must have at least 3 characters and `password` must have at least 6 characters.
   - If there's no invite associated with the token, a 403 is returned with body `{error: 'token'}`.
   - If there's already an account with that email, a 403 is returned with body `{error: 'email'}`.
   - If there's already an account with that username, a 403 is returned with body `{error: 'username'}`.

- `GET /auth/verify/TOKEN` (for verifying email ownership).
   - Does not require the user to be logged in.
   - If successful, a 302 is returned redirecting to `/`.
   - If the token provided doesn't match what's on the database, a 403 is returned.

- `POST /auth/recover`.
   - Does not require the user to be logged in.
   - Body must be `{username: STRING}`. The username can be either the username or the email.
   - If username is invalid, a 403 is returned.
   - If successful, it sends an email to the associated email address with a link for password recovery.

- `POST /auth/reset`.
   - Does not require the user to be logged in.
   - Body must be `{username: STRING, password: STRING, token: STRING}`. The username can be either the username or the email.
   - If username is invalid, a 403 is returned.
   - If successful, it sends an email to the associated email address with a link for password recovery.

- `GET /auth/logout`.
   - Unless there's an error, the route will return a 302 code with the `location` header set to `/`.

- `POST /auth/delete`.
   - User must be logged in, otherwise a 403 is returned.
   - Can be used to delete own account or to delete another user account (if admin).
   - Temporarily disabled in non-local environments if used to delete own account (route always returns 501).
   - If the body contains a key `user` with the id of an user, said user's account will be deleted if the user performing the request is an admin. To delete own account, send an empty object.

- `POST /auth/changePassword`.
   - Body must be `{old: STRING, new: STRING}`.

#### App routes

`POST /feedback`
   - Body must be an object of the form `{message: STRING}` (otherwise 400).
   - If successful, returns a 200.

- `GET /piv/ID`
   - Piv must exist and the user must have permissions to see it (otherwise, 404).
   - Depending on ETag, a 200 or 304 is returned.
   - If the file is not found, a 404 is returned.
   - If the file is a non-mp4 video:
      - If the `original` query parameter is truthy, the original video is served.
      - Otherwise, the mp4 version of the video is served. If the conversion is still ongoing, a 404 is returned with body `'pending'`. If the conversion ended up in an error, a 500 is returned with body `'error'`.
   - If a valid `range` header is present, a 206 is returned along with the requested part of the file.

- `GET /thumb/SIZE/ID`
   - Thumb must exist and the user must have permissions to see it (otherwise, 404).
   - Size must be 200 or 900.
   - If the piv has no thumbnail for that size, the original piv is returned.
   - Depending on ETag, a 200 or 304 is returned.
   - If the file is not found, a 404 is returned.

- `GET /thumbof/ID`
   - Gets the smallest thumbnail (or the piv, if the piv has none) of the piv with id ID.
   - Piv must exist and the user must have permissions to see it (otherwise, 404).
   - Depending on ETag, a 200 or 304 is returned.
   - If the file is not found, a 404 is returned.

- `POST /upload`
   - Body can have one of five forms:
      - `{op: 'start', tags: UNDEFINED|[STRING, ...], total: INTEGER, tooLarge: UNDEFINED|{STRING, ...], unsupported: UNDEFINED|[STRING, ...]}}`
      - `{op: 'complete', id: INTEGER}`
      - `{op: 'cancel',   id: INTEGER}`
      - `{op: 'wait',     id: INTEGER}`
      - `{op: 'error',    id: INTEGER, error: OBJECT}`
   - The body can contain a field `provider` with value `'google'|'dropbox'` and a field `alreadyImported` that should be an integer larger than 0. This can only happen if the request comes from the server itself as part of an import process; if the IP is not from the server itself, 403 is returned.
   - If `tags` are present, none of them should start with `[a-z]::`. These tags are reserved for internal use of the app. Note that because tags are trimmed, if a tag starts with whitespace and then `[a-z]::`, the tag will still be considered as a tag for internal use, therefore invalid in this context.
   - If an `id` is provided in the case of `complete`, `cancel`, `wait` or `error`, it must correspond to that of an existing upload, otherwise the endpoint returns 404 with body `{error: 'upload'}`.
   - In the case of `complete` or `cancel`, the existing upload must have a status of `uploading`, otherwise the endpoint returns 409 with body `{error: 'status: complete|cancelled|stalled|error'}`. The same happens with a `start` on an upload that already has the same `id`.
   - In the case of `wait`, the existing upload must have a status of `uploading` or `stalled, otherwise the endpoint returns 409 as in the case we just mentioned above. This operation is used to warn the server not to consider the upload stalled in the case a file is taking more than ten minutes to be uploaded; it can also be used to revive a stalled upload.
   - If successful, the endpoint returns a body of the form `{id: INTEGER}`. In the case of a `start` operation, this id should be used for an ulterior `end` or `cancel`.

- `POST /uploadCheck`
   - This route is used to see if a piv has already been uploaded.
   - Body must be of the form `{ID: INTEGER (id of the upload), hash: STRING, name: STRING, size: INTEGER, lastModified: INTEGER, tags: UNDEFINED|[STRING, ...]}`.
   - If `tags` are included, after being trimmed, none of them should start with `[a-z]::` (otherwise, 400 with body `{error: 'invalid tag'}`).
   - `body.size` must be the size in bytes of the file being checked.
   - `body.id` must be that of an existing upload id, otherwise the endpoint returns 404 with body `{error: 'upload'}`; if the upload exists but its status is not `uploading`, the endpoint returns 409 with body `{error: 'status: complete|cancelled|stalled|error'}`.
   - If there's already a piv with the same bytes (whether with the same name or not), the endpoint will reply `{repeated: true}`, otherwise it will return `{repeated: false}`.
   - If the piv matches another one already present and `lastModified` and/or a date parsed from the `name` is a date not held by the metadata of the piv already present, those dates will be added to it.

- `POST /piv`
   - Must be a multipart request (and it should include a `content-type` header with value `multipart/form-data`) (otherwise, 400 with body `{error: 'multipart'}`).
   - Must contain exactly one file with name `piv` (otherwise, 400 with body `{error: 'file'}`).
   - Must contain no extraneous fields (otherwise, 400 with body `{error: 'invalidField'}`). The only allowed fields are `id`, `lastModified`, `tags` and `importData`; the last two are optional.
   - Must contain a field `id` with an upload id (otherwise, 400 with body `{error: 'id'}`. The `id` groups different uploaded files into an upload unit, for UI purposes. The `id` should be a timestamp in milliseconds returned by a previous call to `POST /upload`. If no upload with such `id` exists, the endpoint returns 404. The upload with that `id` should have a `status` of `uploading`; if it is not, a 409 is returned with body `{error: 'status: complete|cancelled|stalled|error'}`.
   - Must include a `lastModified` field that's parseable to an integer (otherwise, 400 with body `{error: 'lastModified'}`).
   - If it includes a `tag` field, it must be an array (otherwise, 400 with body `{error: 'tags'}`). After being trimmed, none of them should start with `[a-z]::` (otherwise, 400 with body `{error: 'invalid tag'}`).
   - Can contain a field `importData` with value `{provider: 'google'|'dropbox', id: FILE_ID, name: STRING, modificationTime: FILE_MODIFICATION_TIME, path: STRING}`. This can only happen if the request comes from the server itself as part of an import process; if the IP is not from the server itself, 403 is returned.
   - The file uploaded must be one of the allowed formats: `jpeg`, `png`, `bmp`, `heic`, `gif`, `tiff`, `webp`, `mp4`, `mov`, `3gp`, `avi`, `webm`, `wmv` and `m4v` (otherwise, 400 with body `{error: 'format'}`).
   - The file must be at most 2GB bytes (otherwise, 400 with body `{error: 'tooLarge'}`).
   - If the file is not a valid piv, a 400 is returned with body `{error: 'Invalid piv', data: {...}}`.
   - If a file exists for that user that is both identical to an existing one and also having the same name, a 200 is returned with body `{alreadyUploaded: true, id: STRING}`, where `ID` is the ID of the identical piv that is already uploaded.
   - If a file exists for that user that is either identical but has a different name than an existing one, or that is the same after stripping the metadata and without regard to the original name, a 200 is returned with body `{repeated: true, id: STRING}`, where `ID` is the ID of the identical piv that is already uploaded.
   - In the case for both repeated or already uploaded, and `lastModified` and/or a date parsed from the `name` is a date not held by the metadata of the piv already present, those dates will be added to it.
   - If the storage capacity for that user is exceeded, a 409 is returned with body `{error: 'capacity'}`.
   - If the upload is successful, a 200 is returned with body `{id: ID, deg: 90|180|-90|undefined}`, where `ID` is the ID of the piv just uploaded and `deg` is the rotation automatically applied to the piv based on its metadata.

- `POST /delete`
   - Body must be of the form `{ids: [STRING, ...]}` (otherwise, 400 with body `{error: ...}`).
   - Array with ids can be empty.
   - All pivs must exist and user must be owner of the pivs, otherwise a 404 is returned.
   - There should be no repeated ids on the body, otherwise a 400 is returned.
   - If the deletion is successful, a 200 is returned.

- `POST /rotate`
   - Body must be of the form `{ids: [STRING, ...], deg: 90|180|-90}` (otherwise, 400 with body `{error: ...}`).
   - All pivs must exist and user must be owner of the pivs, otherwise a 404 is returned.
   - Videos will not be rotated and will be silently ignored.
   - There should be no repeated ids on the body, otherwise a 400 is returned.
   - If the rotation is successful, a 200 is returned.

- `POST /date`
   - Body must be of the form `{ids: [STRING, ...], date: INTEGER}` (otherwise, 400 with body `{error: ...}`). `date` must be equal or greater than 0.
   - All pivs must exist and user must be owner of the pivs, otherwise a 404 is returned.
   - There should be no repeated ids on the body, otherwise a 400 is returned.
   - On each of the pivs, if the existing `date` field has a positive offset from UTC midnight, this offset will be added to the provided `date`.

- `POST /tag`
   - Body must be of the form `{tag: STRING, ids: [STRING, ...], del: true|false|undefined}`
   - `tag` will be trimmed (any whitespace at the beginning or end of the string will be eliminated; space-like characters in the middle will be replaced with a single space).
   - After trimmed, `tag` cannot start with `[a-z]::`.
   - If `del` is `true`, the tag will be removed, otherwise it will be added.
   - All pivs must exist and user must be owner of the pivs, otherwise a 404 is returned.
   - There should be no repeated tags on the body, otherwise a 400 is returned.
   - If successful, returns a 200.

- `GET /tags`
   - Returns an array of the form `['tag1', 'tag2', ...]`. This list also includes year tags and geotags, but it doesn't include `a::`, `d::`, or tags shared with the user by other users.

- `POST /hometags`
   - Body must be of the form `{hometags: [STRING, ...]}`.
   - Each of the tags must be a string that does not start with `[a-z]::`.
   - All the tags must exist and user must be owner of the pivs, otherwise a 404 is returned.
   - There should be no repeated tags on the query, otherwise a 400 is returned.
   - If successful, returns a 200.

- `POST /query`
   - Body must be of the form `{tags: [STRING, ...], mindate: INT|UNDEFINED, maxdate: INT|UNDEFINED, sort: newest|oldest|upload, from: INT|UNDEFINED, fromDate: INT|UNDEFINED, to: INT, recentlyTagged: [STRING, ...]|UNDEFINED, refresh: UNDEFINED|BOOLEAN}`. Otherwise, a 400 is returned with body `{error: ...}`.
   - `body.from` and `body.to` must be positive integers, and `body.to` must be equal or larger to `body.from`. For a given query, they provide pagination capability. Both are indexes (starting at 1) that specify the first and the last piv to be returned from a certain query. If both are equal to 1, the first piv for the query will be returned. If they are 1 & 10 respectively, the first ten pivs for the query will be returned.
   - If `body.fromDate` is present, `body.from` must be absent. `body.fromDate` should be an integer larger than 1, and it represents a timestamp. For the provided query, the server will find the index of the piv with the `date` (or `dateup` in the case of `sort` being `upload`) and use that as the `from` parameter. For example, if `fromDate` is `X`, `to` is 100 and `sort` is `newest`, the query will return the 100 pivs that match the query that were taken at `X` onwards.
   - `a::` cannot be included on `body.tags`. If you want to search for all available pivs, set `body.tags` to an empty array. If you send this tag, you'll get a 400 with body `{error: 'all'}`.
   - `untagged` can be included on `body.tags` to retrieve untagged pivs. Untagged pivs are those that have no user tags on them - tags added automatically by the server (such as year/month tags or geotags) don't count as tags in this regard.
   - Each of the returned pivs will have all the tags present in `body.tags`. The only exception to this rule are year tags, on which the query returns pivs that contain at least one of the given date tags. For example, the query `['d::2018', 'd::2019']` will return pivs from both 2018 and 2019.
   - If defined, `body.mindate` & `body.maxdate` must be UTC dates in milliseconds.
   - `body.sort` determines whether sorting is done by `newest`, `oldest`, or `upload`. The first two criteria use the *earliest* date that can be retrieved from the metadata of the piv, or the `lastModified` field. In the case of the `upload`, the sorting is by *newest* upload date; there's no option to sort by oldest upload.
   - If `body.recentlyTagged` is present, the `'u::'` tag must be on the query. `recentlyTagged` is a list of ids that, if they are ids of piv owned by the user, will be included as a result of the query, even if they are not untagged pivs.
   - If `body.refresh` is set to `true`, this will be considered as a request triggered by an automatic refresh by the client. This only makes a difference for statistical purposes.
   - If the query is successful, a 200 is returned with body `pivs: [{...}], total: INT, tags: {'a::': INT, 'u::': INT, 'o::': INT, 'u::': 0, otherTag1: INT, ...}, refreshQuery: true|UNDEFINED}`.
      - Each element within `body.pivs` is an object corresponding to a piv and contains these fields: `{date: INT, dateup: INT, id: STRING,  owner: STRING, name: STRING, dimh: INT, dimw: INT, tags: [STRING, ...], deg: INT|UNDEFINED, vid: UNDEFINED|'pending'|'error'|true}`.
      - `body.total` contains the number of total pivs matched by the query (notice it can be larger than the amount of pivs in `body.pivs`).
      - `body.tags` is an object where every key is one of the tags relevant to the current query - if any of these tags is added to the tags sent on the request body, the result of the query will be non-empty. The values for each key indicate how many pivs within the query have that tag. The only exception is `a::`, which indicate the *total* amount of all pivs, irrespective of the query. `u::` stands for untagged pivs, `o::` for pivs marked as organized, and `t::` for pivs not yet marked as organized.
      - `body.refreshQuery`, if set, indicates that there's either an upload ongoing or a geotagging process ongoing or a video conversion to mp4 for one of the requested pivs (or multiple of them at the same time), in which case it makes sense to repeat the query after a short amount of time to update the results.
   - If `body.idsOnly` is present, only a list of ids will be returned. When this parameter is enabled, `body.from`, `body.to` and `body.sort` will be ignored; in other words, an array with all the ids matching the query will be returned. This enables the "select all" functionality.

- `POST /share`
   - Body must be of the form `{tag: STRING, whom: ID, del: BOOLEAN|UNDEFINED}`.
   - The target user (`body.whom`) must exist, otherwise a 404 is returned.
   - If the tag being shared, after being trimmed, starts with `[a-z]::`, a 400 is returned with body `{error: 'tag'}`.
   - If try to share with yourself, a 400 is returned with body `{error: 'self'}`.
   - If successful, returns a 200.

- `GET /share`
   - If successful, returns a 200 with body `{sho: [[USERNAME1, TAG1], ...], shm: [[USERNAME2, TAG2], ...]}`.
   - `body.sho` lists the tags shared with others by the user. `body.shm` lists the tags shared with the user.

- `POST /download`
   - Body must be of the form `{ids: [STRING, ...]}` (otherwise, 400 with body `{error: ...}`).
   - There should be no repeated ids on the query, otherwise a 400 is returned.
   - `body.ids` must have at least a length of 2 (otherwise, 400 with body `{error: 'single'}`. To download a single piv you can use `GET /piv/ID?original=1` instead.
   - All pivs must exist and user must be owner of the pivs or have the pivs shared with them, otherwise a 404 is returned.
   - If successful, returns a 200 with body `{id: STRING}`. The `id` corresponds to a temporary download file that lasts 5 seconds and is only valid for the user that requested the download.

- `GET /download/ID`
   - `ID` is an id returned by `POST /download`.
   - If there's no such download, or if the user doesn't requested that download, a 404 is returned.
   - If successful, the user will receive a zip file with the specified pivs.

- `POST /dismiss`
   - Disables suggestions shown to new users.
   - Body must be of the form `{operation: 'geotagging|selection'}`.

- `POST /geo`
   - Enables or disables geotagging.
   - Body must be of the form `{operation: 'enable|disable'}`.
   - If an operation is ongoing while the request is being made, the server will reply with a 409 code. Otherwise it will reply with a 200 code.
   - In the case of enabling geotagging, a server reply doesn't mean that the geotagging is complete, since it's a background process that might take minutes. In contrast, when disabling geotagging a 200 response will be sent after the geotags are removed, without the need for a background p rocess.

- `GET /uploads`
   - If successful, returns a 200 with an array as body. The array contains one or more of the following objects: `{id: INTEGER (also functions as start time), total: INTEGER, status: uploading|complete|cancelled|stalled|error, unsupported: UNDEFINED|[STRING, ...], alreadyImported: INTEGER|UNDEFINED (only for uploads of imports), alreadyUploaded: INTEGER|UNDEFINED, tags: [STRING, ...]|UNDEFINED, end: INTEGER|UNDEFINED, ok: INTEGER|UNDEFINED, repeated: [STRING, ...]|UNDEFINED, repeatedSize: INTEGER|UNDEFINED, invalid: [STRING, ...]|UNDEFINED, tooLarge: [STRING, ...]|UNDEFINED, lastPiv: {id: STRING, deg: UNDEFINED|90|-90|180}, error: UNDEFINED|STRING|OBJECT, providerErrors: UNDEFINED|[STRING|OBJECT, ...]}`.

- `GET /imports/PROVIDER`
   - If successful, returns a 200 with an array as body. Each of the elements is either an upload corresponding to the import (with the same shape of those returned by `GET /uploads`); if there's an import process that has not reached the upload stage yet, it will be the first element of the array and have the shape `{id: INTEGER, provider: PROVIDER, status: listing|ready|error, fileCount: INTEGER|UNDEFINED, folderCount: INTEGER|UNDEFINED, error: STRING|OBJECT|UNDEFINED, selection: UNDEFINED|[ID, ...], data: UNDEFINED|{roots: [ID, ...], folders: [{id: ID, name: ..., count: INTEGER, parent: ID, children: [ID, ...]}]}}`. If oauth access hasn't been provided yet, the reply will be of the form `[{redirect: URL, provider: PROVIDER}]`, where `URL` is the URL to start the OAuth authorization process for that provider.

- `GET /account`
   - If successful, returns a 200 with body `{username: STRING, email: STRING, type: STRING, created: INTEGER, usage: {limit: INTEGER, byfs: INTEGER, bys3: INTEGER}, geo: true|UNDEFINED , geoInProgress: true|UNDEFINED, suggestGeotagging: true|UNDEFINED, suggestSelection: true|UNDEFINED}`.

- `GET /import/oauth/PROVIDER`
   - Receives the redirection from the oauth provider containing a temporary authorization code.
   - If no query parameters are received, the route responds with a 400.
   - If no authorization code is received, the route responds with a 403.
   - If the request for an access token is not successful, the route responds with a 403 and with a body of the shape `{code: <CODE RETURNED BY PROVIDER'S API>, body: <BODY RETURNED BY REQUEST TO PROVIDER'S API>}`.
   - If the request for an access token is successful, the route responds with a 200.

- `POST /import/list/PROVIDER`
   - Creates a list of available folders with pivs/videos in the PROVIDER's cloud, or provides a `redirect` URL for the OAuth flow if the authorization credentials for that provider haven't been requested yet.
   - If the credentials have not been requested yet, the endpoint returns a body with the shape `{redirect: URL}`. `URL` is the URL to start the OAuth authorization process for that provider.
   - If the credentials are already granted but authentication against the provider fails, the endpoint returns a 403 with a body of the shape `{code: <CODE RETURNED BY PROVIDER'S API>, body: <BODY RETURNED BY REQUEST TO PROVIDER'S API>}`.
   - If there's already a list ready or the import is in the process of uploading, a 409 is returned to the client.
   - If there's access or refresh tokens and no import process ongoing, a process is started to query the PROVIDER's API and 200 is returned to the client. The listing will be performed asynchronously after replying the 200 to the request.

- `POST /import/cancel/PROVIDER`
   - Deletes list of files/folders available in the PROVIDER's cloud.
   - If no listing was done, the route succeeds anyway.
   - If successful, the route returns no body.

- `POST /import/select/PROVIDER`
   - Updates the list of selected folders for import from `PROVIDER`.
   - Requires a list of files to be present; otherwise a 404 is returned.
   - If the import is listing, uploading or experienced an error, a 409 is returned.
   - The body must be of the shape `{ids: [ID, ...]}`.
   - If any of the ids doesn't belong to a folder id on the `PROVIDER`'s list, a 400 is returned.
   - If there previously was an array of selected folder ids on the list, it will be overwritten.

- `POST /import/upload/PROVIDER`
   - If no credentials are present or the credentials are already granted but authentication against the provider fails, the endpoint returns a 403 with a body of the shape `{code: <CODE RETURNED BY PROVIDER'S API>, body: <BODY RETURNED BY REQUEST TO PROVIDER'S API>}`.
   - If there's no import process present, returns a 404.
   - If there's an import process present but 1) the listing process is ongoing; or 2) there was an error; or 3) there are no folders selected yet; or 4) the import process already started; the endpoint returns a 409.
   - If all initial checks pass, the endpoint will return 200 and perform its operations asynchronously.
   - The endpoint will upload one by one the files from supported formats that are in the selection of folders. The import key will be updated so that the user can query for updates by retrieving the list.
   - Depending on whether the process ends with an error or with success, the endpoint will update either the import entry (in case of error) or delete it and add an user log entry (in case of success).

   3. `keydown` -> `key down KEYCODE`
   4. `keyup` -> `key up KEYCODE`
   5. `scroll` -> `scroll []`

   8. `dragover` -> do nothing
   9. `drop` -> `drop files EVENT`
   10. `touchstart` -> `touch start`
   11. `touchend` -> `touch end`

2. General
   1. `initialize`: calls `reset store` and `retrieve csrf`. Then mounts `views.base` in the body. Executed at the end of the script. Burns after being matched. Also sets viewport width for zooming out in mobile. Finally, it sets an interval in `State.uploadRefresh` that will prevent the screen/disk from going to sleep while `State.upload.queue` is not empty.
   2. `reset store`: If its first argument (`logout`) is truthy, it clears out `B.r.log` (to remove all user data from the local event log) and sets `lastLogout` to the current date. Notes `State.redirect` and (re)initializes `B.store.State` and `B.store.Data` to empty objects (with the exception of `State.redirect`) and sets the global variables `State` and `Data` to these objects (so that they can be quickly printed from the console).
   3. `clear snackbar`: clears the timeout in `State.snackbar.timeout` (if present) and removes `State.snackbar`.
   4. `snackbar`: calls `clear snackbar` and sets `State.snackbar` (shown in a snackbar) for 4 seconds. Takes a path with the color (`green|red`) and the message to be printed as the first argument. As second argument it takes a flag `noSnackbar` that doesn't set a timeout to clear the snackbar.
   5. `get` & `post`: wrapper for ajax functions.
      - `path` is the HTTP path (the first path member, the rest is ignored and actually shouldn't be there).
      - Takes `headers`, `body` and optional `cb`.
      - Removes last log to excise password or token information from `B.r.log`.
      - Adds `Data.csrf` to all `POST` requests except `/requestInvite`, `/auth/login` and `/auth/signup`.
      - If by the time the response from the server is received, the user has just logged out (judging by `lastLogout`), and the request is not an auth request, the callback will not be executed.
      - If 403 is received and it is not an auth route or `GET csrf`, calls `reset store true` (with truthy `logout` argument), `goto page login` and `snackbar`.
   6. `error`: submits browser errors (from `window.onerror`) to the server through `post /error`.
   7. `read hash`: see annotated source code.
   8. `goto page PAGE`: see annotated source code.
   9. `send feedback`: if `State.feedback` is `undefined`, invokes `snackbar yellow`. Otherwise, it invokes `post feedback` and then invokes `snackbar`.
   10. `test`: loads the test suite.

3. Auth
   1. `retrieve csrf`: takes no arguments. Calls `get /csrf`. In case of non-403 error, calls `snackbar`; otherwise, it sets `Data.csrf` to either the CSRF token returned by the call, or `false` if the server replied with a 403. Also invokes `read hash` to kick off the navigation after we determine whether the user is logged in or not. Finally, if there was no error, it invokes `query account`.
   3. `login`: calls `post /auth/login. In case of error, calls `snackbar`; otherwise, it calls `clear authInputs`, updates `Data.csrf`, invokes `query account` and invokes `goto page State.redirect`.
   4. `logout`: takes no arguments. Calls `post /auth/logout`). In case of error, calls `snackbar`; otherwise, calls `reset store` (with truthy `logout` argument) and invokes `goto page login`.
   5. `signup`: calls `post /auth/signup`. In case of error, calls `snackbar`; otherwise, it calls `clear authInputs`, updates `Data.csrf`, invokes `query account` and invokes `goto page State.redirect`.
   6. `recover`: calls `post /auth/recover`. In case of error, only calls `snackbar`; otherwise, it calls `clear authInputs`, invokes `goto page login` and invokes `snackbar`.
   7. `reset`: calls `post /auth/reset`. In case of error, only calls `snackbar`; otherwise it calls `rem Data.tokens`, `clear authInputs`, `goto page login` and `snackbar`.
   8. `delete account`: calls `post /auth/delete`. In case of error, only calls `snackbar`; otherwise it calls `reset store true`, `goto page login` and `snackbar`.
   9. `clear authInputs`: sets the values of all possible auth inputs (`#auth-username`, `#auth-password` and `#auth-confirm`) to an empty string.
   10. `request invite`: calls `post /requestInvite`. Calls `snackbar` with either an error or a success message.

4. Pics
   1. `change State.page`: see annotated source code.
   2. `change State.query`: see annotated source code.
   3. `change State.selected`: if current page is not `pivs`, it does nothing. Adds & removes classes from `#pics`, adds & removes `selected` class from pivs in `views.grid` (this is done here for performance purposes, instead of making `views.grid` redraw itself when the `State.selected` changes). If there are no more pivs selected and `State.query.recentlyTagged` is set, we `rem` it and invoke `snackbar`.
   4. `query pivs`:
      - If `State.query` is not set, does nothing.
      - If `State.querying` is set and the `options.retry` passed to the responder is not truthy, it will overwrite `State.querying` with `{t: INTEGER, options: {...}}` and do nothing else. This will prevent a concurrent query call to the server; later we'll add logic to make the responder re-invoke itself if a later query requests has happened while a request is being sent to the server.
      - It sets `State.querying` to `{t: INTEGER, options: {...}}`.
      - If `State.queryRefresh` is set, it removes it and invokes `clearTimeout` on it.
      - Invokes `post query`, using `State.query`:
         - If `State.query.fromDate` is `undefined` and there are no pivs in `State.selected`, it will call the endpoint using the parameter `from` set to `1`. Otherwise, it will call the endpoint using the parameter `fromDate`, set to either `query.fromDate` or to the farthest date from any piv in `State.selected`, whichever of the two dates is the farthest one. The farthest date will be the *newest* one if `query.sort` is `oldest`, and the *oldest* one otherwise.
         - The `to` parameter will be the largest chunk size times three (`teishi.last (H.chunkSizes) * 3`). If `options.selectAll` is set, it will be set to a very large number instead.
         - If there's a range pseudo-tag (which is a strictly frontend query representing a date range), its values will be used as the `mindate` and `maxdate` parameters sent to the server.
         - The third argument passed to the responder will be passed in the `refresh` field.
         - If `State.query.update` is set to `'auto'`, or if there are no pivs yet in `Data.pivs`, it will set `updateLimit` to the present moment; otherwise, it will pass the value of `State.query.updateLimit`.
      - Once the query is done, if `State.querying.t` is larger than the time at which the current query started, this means we need to retry. In this case, the responder will re-invoke itself using `State.querying.options` but also adding `retry = true` to it.
      - If we're here, the query didn't change, so there is no need to retry it. It sets `State.querying` to `undefined`.
      - If the query returned an error, it invokes `snackbar` and doesn't do anything else.
      - If the query returned no pivs and one or more tags were present in `query.tags`, it will `set` `State.query.tags` to an empty array and do nothing else, in order to avoid a ronin (empty) query. This will only happen through a deletion of the entire contents of the query, or an untagging of the entire contents on the query on another client.
      - If `body.refreshQuery` is set to `true` and `State.query.update` is `undefined`, it will set it to `'manual'`, to indicate that updates are available. This will only happen if `Data.pivs` already has pivs.
      - If `body.refreshQuery` is falsy and `State.query.update` is not `undefined` and `State.query.updateLimit` is less than 10ms away from the time we made the query, it will will set `State.query.update` to `undefined`, to indicate that updates are no longer available.
      - If before the query there were no pivs in `Data.pivs`, `State.query.updateLimit` will be updated to the present moment, to avoid a further query using an outdated value that will make the pics view oscillate between being empty and having pivs.
      - Invokes `query tags`.
      - If the query contains a year tag, a second query equal to the current query minus the month tags will be performed to the server and the returned `queryTags` field will be set in `Data.monthTags` (just the tags, not the number of pivs for each); if the query does not contain a year tag, it will remove `Data.monthTags`. If this query fails, an error will be printed, but the responder will continue executing the rest of the logic.
      - It sets `Data.queryTags`and `Data.pivTotal` based on the result of the query.
      - If `body.refreshQuery` is set to `true`, it will set `State.querying` to a timeout that invokes `query pivs {refresh: true}` after 1500ms. The truthy `refresh` indicates that this is a request triggered by an automatic refresh.
      - It updates `State.selected` to filter out those pivs that are no longer returned by the current query. The updates to `State.selected`, are done directly without an event; the `change` event will be fired afterwards in the responder logic. If `options.selectAll` is passed, all pivs will be marked as selected.
      - It sets `Data.pivs` to `rs.body.pivs` without an event, to avoid redrawing jsut yet.
      - It sets `State.chunks` to the output of `H.computeChunks`, also without an event, to avoid redrawing just yet.
      - If `options.refresh` is set to `true`, we'll set `query.fromDate` to the current value of `State.query.fromDate`, since the `fromDate` info from a refresh will be stale if scrolls have happened afterwards.
      - It invokes `scroll` since that will match a responder that calculates chunk visibility and optionally scrolls to a y-offset.
         - If `options.noScroll` is set, it will invoke `scroll [] -1`. This will prevent scrolling.
         - If there's no `fromDate` set, it will invoke `scroll [] 0`. This will scroll the screen to the top.
         - Otherwise it will invoke `scroll [] DATE`, where `DATE` is the date of the first piv whose `date` or `dateup` matches `query.fromDate`. This is done in the following way: we find the first piv that has a `date` (or `dateup`, if `query.sort` is `upload`) that's the same or less as `query.fromDate` (the same or more if `query.sort` is `oldest`). If `query.refresh` is `true`, an `offset` is added, which consists of how many pixels are hidden from the topmost row of visible pivs - this will make the scrolling not jump.
      - If `options.selectAll` is passed, it will invoke `clear snackbar` and `change State.selected`.
      - If `State.open` is not set, it will trigger a `change` event on `Data.pivs` to the pivs returned by the query. If we entered this conditional, the responder won't do anything else.
      - If we're here, `State.open` is set. We check whether the piv previously opened is still on the list of pivs returned by the query. If it is no longer in the query, it invokes `rem State.open` and `change Data.pivs`. It will also invoke `exit fullscreen`. If we entered this conditional, the responder won't do anything else.
      - If we're here, `State.open` is set and the piv previously opened is still contained in the current query. It will `set State.open` and fire a `change` event on `Data.pivs`.
   5. `click piv piv k ev`: depends on `State.lastClick` and `State.selected`. If it registers a double click on a piv, it removes `State.selected.PIVID` and sets `State.open`. Otherwise, it will change the selection status of the piv itself; if `shift` is pressed (judging by reading the `shiftKey` of `ev` and the previous click was done on a piv still displayed, it will perform multiple selection. The `piv` argument is an object containing only the `id`, `date` and `dateup` fields, since the rest of them are not relevant for the purposes of the responder.
   6. `key down|up`: if `keyCode` is 13 and `#newTag` is focused, invoke `tag pivs`; if `keyCode` is 13 and `#uploadTag` is focused, invoke `upload tag`; if the path is `down` and keycode is either 46 (delete) or 8 (backspace) and there are selected pivs, it invokes `delete pivs`.
   7. `toggle tag`: see annotated source code.
   8. `toggle hometag`: see annotated source code.
   9. `shift hometag`: see annotated source code.
   10. `select all`: places in `State.selected` all the pivs currently loaded; if the number of selected pivs is larger than 2k, it invokes `snackbar`; finally invokes `query pivs {selectAll: true}`.
   11. `query tags`: invokes `get tags` and sets `Data.tags`. It checks whether any of the tags in `State.query.tags` no longer exists and removes them from there (with the exception of `'u::'`, `'o::'` and `'t::'` (which never are returned by the server) and the strictly client-side range pseudo-tag).
   12. `tag pivs`: see annotated source code.
   13. `rotate pivs`: invokes `post rotate`, using `State.selected`. In case the query is successful it invokes `query pivs`. In case of error, invokes `snackbar`. If it receives a second argument (which is a piv), it submits its id instead of `State.selected`.
   14. `date pivs`: invokes `snackbar` if there was either invalid input or the operation failed. If the input (`State.date`) is valid, it invokes `post date` and then if the operation is successful invokes `rem State.page` and `query pivs`.
   15. `delete pivs`: invokes `post delete`, using `State.selected`. In case the query is successful it invokes `query pivs`. In case of error, invokes `snackbar`.
   16. `scroll`:
      - Only will perform actions if `State.page` is `pivs`.
      - If the `to` argument is `undefined` and `State.scroll` exists and happened less than 50ms ago, the responder won't do anything else - effectively ignoring the call.
      - If `to` is set to `-1` or `undefined`, our reference `y` position will be the current one.
      - Will set `State.lastScroll` to `{y: y, time: INTEGER}`.
      - Depending on the height of the window and the current `y`, it will directly set the `DOMVisible` and `userVisible` properties of the chunks within `State.chunks`, without an event being fired.
      - If there were changes to the `DOMVisible` or `userVisible` properties of one or more chunks, it will then fire the `change` event on both `State.chunks` and `State.selected`.
      - It will `set State.query.fromDate` to the `date` (or `dateup` if `State.query.sort` is `upload`) of the first piv that's at least partly visible in the viewport.
      - If a `to` parameter is passed that is not -1, it will scroll to that `y` position after a timeout of 0ms. The timeout is there to allow for DOM operations to conclude before scrolling.
      - Note: the scroll responder has an overall flow of the following shape: 1) determine visibility; 2) trigger changes that will redraw the grid; 3) update `State.query.fromDate`; 4) if necesary, scroll to the right position.
   17. `download`: uses `State.selected`. Invokes `post download`. If unsuccessful, invokes `snackbar`.
   18. `stop propagation`: stops propagation of the `ev` passed as an argument.
   19. `change State.queryURL`: see annotated source code.
   20. `update queryURL`: see annotated source code.

5. Open
   1. `key down`: if `State.open` is set, invokes `open prev` (if `keyCode` is 37) or `open next` (if `keyCode` is 39).
   2. `enter fullscreen`: enter fullscreen using the native browser methods and set the `<body>` `overflow` to `hidden`.
   3. `exit fullscreen`: if `State.open` is present, remove it. Depending on the `exited` flag passed to the invocation, exit fullscreen using the native browser methods. Also remove the `<body>` `overflow` property so it reverts to the defaut.
   4. `change State.open`: remove or add `app-fullscreen` class from `#pics`, depending on whether `State.open` is defined. If `State.open` is defined, it invokes `enter fullscreen`.
   5. `open prev|next`: decrements or increments `State.open.k`, as long as there's a previous (or next) piv. It will also scroll the window to the `start` position of the piv currently open (so that the grid scrolls up or down when the user goes back or forth within the `open` view).
   6. `touch start`: only performs actions if `State.open` is set. Sets `State.lastTouch`.
   7. `touch end`: only performs actions if `State.open` is set. Reads and deletes `State.lastTouch`. If it happened less than a second ago, it invokes `open prev` or `open next`, depending on the direction of the touch/swipe.
   8. `open location`: takes a `piv` with `loc` field as its argument. Opens Google Maps in a new tab with the specified latitude & longitude. If a second argument is passed instead, that is considered as a url, which is then opened in a new tab.

6. Upload
   1. `change State.page`: if `State.page` is `upload` or `pivs`, 1) if no `Data.tags`, `query tags`; 3) if no `Data.uploads`, `query uploads`.
   2. `drop files`: if `State.page` is `upload`, access dropped files or folders and put them on the upload file input. `add` (without event) items to `State.upload.new.tooLarge`, `State.upload.new.unsupported` and `State.upload.new.files`, then `change State.upload.new`.
   3. `upload files|folder`: `add` (without event) items to `State.upload.new.tooLarge`, `State.upload.new.unsupported` and `State.upload.new.files`, then `change State.upload.new`. Clear up the value of either `#files-upload` or `#folder-upload`. If it's a folder upload, it clears the snackbar warning about possible delays with `clear snackbar`.
   4. `upload start`: invokes `post upload` using `State.upload.new.files`, `State.upload.new.tooLarge`, `State.upload.new.unsupported`, and `State.upload.new.tags`; if there's an error, invokes `snackbar`. Otherwise sets `State.upload.wait.ID`, invokes `query uploads`, adds items from `State.upload.new.files` onto `State.upload.queue`, then deletes `State.upload.new` and invokes `change State.upload.queue`.
   5. `upload cancel|complete|wait|error`: receives an upload `id` as its first argument and an optional `noAjax` flag as the second argument, an optional `noSnackbar` as the third argument and an optional `error` as a fourth argument. If `noAjax` is not `true`, it invokes `post upload` and if there's a server error during this ajax call, it will only invoke `snackbar red` and do nothing else; if the operation is `wait`, it sets `State.upload.wait.ID.lastActivity` and does nothing else; if we're performing the `cancel` or `error` operation, it finds all the files on `State.upload.queue` belonging to the upload with id `id`, filters them out and updates `State.upload.queue`. For all operations except `wait`, it then removes `State.upload.wait.ID`, clears the interval at `State.upload.wait.ID.interval` and invokes `query uploads`; if `noSnackbar` is not `true`, it invokes `snackbar` with a relevant message depending on the operation.
   6. `upload tag`: optionally invokes `snackbar`. Adds a tag to `State.upload.new.tags` and removes `State.upload.tag`.
   7. `query uploads`: if `State.upload.timeout` is set, it removes it and invokes `clearTimeout` on it; it then invokes `get uploads`; if there's an error, invokes `snackbar`; otherwise, sets the body in `Data.uploads` and conditionally sets `State.upload.timeout`. If a timeout is set, the timeout will invoke `query uploads` again after 1500ms.
   8. `change State.upload.queue`: (for each piv that's next in the queue)
      - Increments `State.upload.count.UPLOADID` (or sets it to `1` if it doesn't exist yet).
      - Hashes the file; if there is an error, invokes `upload error` and returns. The call to `upload error` will report the error to the server.
      - Invokes `post uploadCheck` to check if an identical file already exists; if there is an error, invokes `upload error` and returns.
      - If a file with the same hash already exists, the responder removes it from `State.upload.queue`, decrements `State.upload.count.UPLOADID` and conditionally invokes `upload complete` if there are no other files in this upload being processed (`State.upload.count.UPLOADID === 0`) *and* it is part of an upload that still has status `uploading` (as per `Data.uploads`). It then returns.
      - Invokes `post piv` to upload the file.
      - Sets `State.upload.wait.ID.lastActivity`.
      - Removes the file just uploaded from `State.upload.queue`.
      - If space runs out, it invokes `snackbar` and `upload cancel` - the call to `upload cancel` will perform neither an ajax call nor show a snackbar.
      - If there's an unexpected error (not a 400) it invokes `upload error` but it will not perform an ajax call to report it to the server.
      - Decrements `State.upload.count.UPLOADID`.
      - Conditionally invokes `upload complete` if there are no other files in this upload being processed (`State.upload.count.UPLOADID === 0`) *and* it is part of an upload that still has status `uploading` (as per `Data.uploads`).
      - Note: the logic of `State.upload.count.UPLOADID` works because we decrement *after* updating the queue. This updating of the queue triggers a recursive call to the responder itself, which brings another piv into processing, which increments the queue. In that way, the count entry for an upload reaches 0 only at the very end.

7. Import
   1. `change State.page`: if `State.page` is `import`, 1) for all providers, if `State.import.PROVIDER.authOK` is set, it deletes it and invokes `import list PROVIDER true` to create a new list; 3) for all providers, if `State.import.PROVIDER.authError` is set, it deletes it and invokes `snackbar`; 4) for all providers, if there's no `Data.import.PROVIDER`, invokes `import list PROVIDER`.
   2. `query imports PROVIDER`: if `State.imports.PROVIDER.timeout` is set, it removes it and invokes `clearTimeout` on it; it then invokes `get imports/PROVIDER`; if the request is unsuccessful, invokes `snackbar red`, otherwise sets `set Data.imports.PROVIDER` to the result of the query; it conditionally sets `State.imports.PROVIDER.selection` and `State.imports.PROVIDER.timeout`. If a timeout is set, the timeout will invoke `query imports` again after 1500ms.
   3. `import list PROVIDER`: invokes `post import/list/PROVIDER`; if unsuccessful, invokes `snackbar`, otherwise invokes `query imports PROVIDER`.
   4. `import cancel PROVIDER`: invokes `post import/cancel/PROVIDER`; invokes `snackbar` and then `query imports PROVIDER`.
   5. `import retry PROVIDER`: invokes `post import/cancel/PROVIDER`; if unsuccessful, invokes `snackbar`, otherwise invokes `import list PROVIDER`.
   6. `import select PROVIDER start`: invokes `post import/select/PROVIDER` passing `State.import.PROVIDER.selection`; if there is an error, invokes `snackbar`. Otherwise, if `start` is not passed it only invokes `query imports PROVIDER`. If the query is successful and `start` is passed, it sets `Data.imports.PROVIDER` and invokes `post import/upload/PROVIDER`; if that invocation is not successful, it invokes `snackbar`, otherwise it invokes `query imports PROVIDER`.

8. Account
   1. `query account`: `get account`; if successful, `set Data.account`, otherwise invokes `snackbar`. Optionally invokes `cb` passed as extra argument.
   2. `dismiss geotagging|selection`: `post dismiss`; if path is `geotagging`, invokes `snackbar`. If successful, invokes `query account`.
   3. `toggle geo dismiss`: `post geo`; if successful, invokes `query account`. It always invokes `snackbar`. If operation is successful, invokes `query pivs` and `query tags`. If `dismiss` is passed, invokes `dismiss geotagging`.
   4. `submit changePassword`: invokes `post auth/changePassword`, invokes `snackbar`; if successful, invokes `clear changePassword`.
   5. `clear changePassword`: clears inputs of the change password fields and removes `State.changePassword`.

### Store

- `State`:
   - `changePassword`: if present, shows the change password form in the account view.

Each chunk has the form `{pivs: [...], start: INT, end: INT, visible: true|false|undefined}`. `pivs` is an array of pivs; `start` and `end` indicate the y-coordinate of the start and the end of the chunk. `visible` indicates whether the chunk should be displayed or not, given the current y-position of the window.
   - `date`: `UNDEFINED|{y: STRING, m: STRING: d: STRING}`. If present, it denotes an object with date fields for dating pivs.
   - `expandCountries`: if set to `true`, it will show more than three country geotags.

      - `googleOAuthBox`: if `true`, shows the instructional Google OAuth dialog.
      - `hideLeaveBox`: if `true`, *hides* the instructional box that indicates that the tab can be closed while an import is listing or uploading.
   - `imports`: if defined, it is an object with one key per provider and as value an object of the form:
```
{
   authOK: UNDEFINED|true, (if present we just confirmed an OAuth flow and we want to start an import process)
   currentFolder: UNDEFINED|STRING,
   showFolders: UNDEFINED|true, (if present, we show the folder list for this provider)
   selection: UNDEFINED|{ID1: true, ...},
   timeout: UNDEFINED|timeout, (if present, a timeout that makes `query imports PROVIDER` invoke itself)
}
```
  `list` determines whether the list of folders for import from the indicated provider is visible; `current` marks the current folder being inspected; and `selected` is a list of folders to be imported; if present, `update` is a javascript interval that updates the list.
   - `lastClick`: if present, has the shape `{id: PIVID, time: INT}`. Used to determine 1) a double-click (which would open the piv in full); 2) range selection with shift.
   - `lastScroll`: if present, has the shape `{y: INT, time: INT}`. Used to determine when to change the visibility of the chunks in `State.chunks` and to potentially invoke `increment nPivs`.
   - `lastTouch`: if present, has the shape `{x: INT, time: INT}`. Used to detect a swipe within `views.open`.
   - `newTag`: the name of a new tag to be posted.
   - `open`: `{id: STRING, k: INTEGER}`. id and index of the piv to be shown in full-screen mode.
   - `page`: determines the current page.

   sort:           'newest|oldest|upload',
   fromDate:       UNDEFINED|INTEGER,
   updateLimit:    UNDEFINED|INTEGER,
   recentlyTagged: UNDEFINED|[ID, ...],
   update:         UNDEFINED|'auto'|'manual',
   home:           UNDEFINED|BOOLEAN
}
```
   - `queryRefresh`: if set, a timeout that invokes `query pivs` after 1500ms.
   - `queryURL`: if set, has the form `{tags: [...], sort: 'newest|oldest|upload', fromDate: UNDEFINED|INTEGER}`. When updated, its data will be used to update `State.query`.
   - `querying`: `UNDEFINED|{t: INTEGER, options: {updateSelected: BOOLEAN|UNDEFINED, refresh: BOOLEAN|UNDEFINED}`, set if `query pivs` is currently querying the server. Its purpose is to avoid concurrent queries to the server.
   - `selected`: an object where each key is a piv id and every value is `{id: STRING, date: INTEGER, dateup: INTEGER}`. If a certain piv key has a corresponding `true` value, the piv is selected.
   - `showNTags`: UNDEFINED|INTEGER, determines the amount of tags seen when no pivs are selected.
   - `showNSelectedTags`: UNDEFINED|INTEGER, determines the amount of tags seen when at least one piv is selected.
   - `snackbar`: prints a snackbar. If present, has the shape: `{color: STRING, message: STRING, timeout: TIMEOUT_FUNCTION}`. `timeout` is the function that will delete `State.snackbar` after a number of seconds. Set by `snackbar` event.
   - `tagOrder`: determines whether tags are sorted by number of pivs or alphabetically, and whether the order should be reverse or not. It is of the shape `{field: 'a|n', reverse: true|false|UNDEFINED}`.
   - `untag`: flag to mark that we're untagging pivs instead of tagging them.
   - `upload`:
      - `count`: `UNDEFINED|{UPLOADID: INTEGER, ...}`. Each entry counts the number of items currently being processed for each upload.
      - `new`: {unsupported: [STRING, ...]|UNDEFINED, files: [...], tags: [...]|UNDEFINED}
      - `queue`: [{file: ..., uid: STRING, tags: [...]|UNDEFINED, uploading: true|UNDEFINED}, ...]
      - `tag`: content of input to filter tag or add a new one.
      - `timeout`: if present, a timeout that invokes `query uploads`.
      - `wait`: if present, an object where every key is an upload id and the value is an array of the form `{lastActivity: INTEGER, interval: SETINTERVAL FUNCTION}`. These are used to determine when a `wait` event should be sent.
   - `uploadRefresh`: an interval that will refresh the page (to prevent the screen and/or disk going to sleep) if `State.upload.queue` is not empty.

- `Data`:
   - `account`: `{username: STRING, email: STRING, type: STRING, created: INTEGER, usage: {limit: INTEGER, used: INTEGER}, suggestGeotagging: true|UNDEFINED, suggestSelection: true|UNDEFINED, onboarding: true|UNDEFINED}`.
   - `csrf`: if there's a valid session, contains a string which is a CSRF token. If there's no session (or the session expired), set to `false`. Useful as both a CSRF token and to tell the client whether there's a valid session or not.
   - `hometags`: an array of tags that are displayed in the home screen of the user.
   - `imports`: an object where each key is a provider. If defined, each key has as value an array with one or more imports. Imports that are in the process of being uploaded or have already been uploaded have the same shape as those in `Data.uploads`. However, there may be up to one import per provider representing an import in a listing or ready state. Also there might be just an object with the keys `redirect` and `provider`, if the OAuth flow has not been done yet.
```
   {
      redirect: STRING|UNDEFINED,
      id: INTEGER|UNDEFINED,
      provider: PROVIDER,
      status:   listing|ready|error|uploading|stalled|complete (uploading/stalled is for imports that are being uploaded)
      fileCount: INTEGER|UNDEFINED,
      folderCount: INTEGER|UNDEFINED,
      error: STRING|OBJECT|UNDEFINED,
      selection: UNDEFINED|[ID, ...],
      data: UNDEFINED|{roots: [ID, ...], folders: [{id: ID, name: STRING, count: INTEGER, parent: ID, children: [ID, ...]}]},
   }
```
   - `monthTags`: either `undefined` or an array with month tags that correspond to the current query. If a month is on the current query, it will be on the list but other months may be there too.
   - `pivs`: `[...]`; comes from `body.pivs` from `query pivs`. A `start` parameter is added to each piv to compute its Y-coordinate.
   - `pivTotal`': UNDEFINED|INTEGER, with the total number of pivs matched by the current query; comes from `body.total` from `query pivs`.
   - `queryTags`: `{'a::': INTEGER, 'u::': INTEGER, tag1: ..., ...}`; comes from `body.tags` from `query pivs`.
   - `reset`: if present, has the form `{token: STRING, username: STRING}`. Used to reset password.
   - `signup`: `{username: STRING, token: STRING, email: STRING}`. Sent from invitation link and used by `signup []`.
   - `tags`: `[TAG1, TAG2, ...]`. Only includes tags created by the user.
   - `uploads`: `[{id: INTEGER (also functions as start time), total: INTEGER, status: uploading|complete|cancelled|stalled|error, unsupported: UNDEFINED|[STRING, ...], alreadyImported: INTEGER|UNDEFINED (only for uploads of imports), alreadyUploaded: INTEGER|UNDEFINED, tags: [STRING, ...]|UNDEFINED, end: INTEGER|UNDEFINED, ok: INTEGER|UNDEFINED, repeated: [STRING, ...]|UNDEFINED, repeatedSize: INTEGER|UNDEFINED, invalid: [STRING, ...]|UNDEFINED, tooLarge: [STRING, ...]|UNDEFINED, lastPiv: {id: STRING, deg: UNDEFINED|90|-90|180}, error: UNDEFINED|STRING|OBJECT, providerErrors: UNDEFINED|[STRING|OBJECT, ...]}, ...]`.

## Annotated source code

For now, we only have annotated fragments of the code. This might be expanded comprehensively later.

### `client.js`

TODO: add annotated source code from the beginning of the file.

We define a responder `read hash`, which will be called whenever the hash component of the URL changes.

```javascript
   ['read', 'hash', {id: 'read hash'}, function (x) {
```

We start by taking `window.location.hash`, splitting it into parts and storing it into a variable `hash`. We'll set a variable `page` to the first part of the hash.

```javascript
      var hash = window.location.hash.replace ('#/', '').split ('/'), page = hash [0];
```

If `page` is `'signup'` and there is a second part in the hash, we decode and parse it and `set` its output into `Data.signup`. This allows us to get the signup data from the URL into javascript for signup purposes.

```javascript
      if (page === 'signup' && hash [1]) B.call (x, 'set', ['Data', 'signup'], teishi.parse (decodeURIComponent (hash [1])));
```

If `page` is `'reset'` and there are both a second and a third part of the hash, we `set Data.reset.token` to the second part of the hash and `Data.reset.username` to the third one.

```javascript
      if (page === 'reset' && hash [1] && hash [2]) B.call (x, 'set', ['Data', 'reset'], {
         token:    decodeURIComponent (hash [1]),
         username: decodeURIComponent (hash [2])
      });
```

If `page` is `'import'` and there is a third part of the hash (which will represent the provider), we `set State.imports.PROVIDER.authOK` or `set State.imports.PROVIDER.authError`, depending on the value of the first part of the hash.

```javascript
      if (page === 'import' && hash [2]) {
         if (hash [1] === 'success') B.call (x, 'set', ['State', 'imports', hash [2], 'authOK'],    true);
         if (hash [1] === 'error'  ) B.call (x, 'set', ['State', 'imports', hash [2], 'authError'], true);
      }
```

If the user is logged in (which will be the case if `Data.csrf` is set) and there's no `page`, or if `page` is `'pics'`, we `set State.queryURL` to either the second part of the hash, or to `'home'` if there's no second part of the hash. We assume that if there's no `page` specified, the right page is `'pics'`, which it will be if the user is logged in. If the user is not logged in, the user will be redirected to the right page by `goto page`. We won't do this if the user is not logged in to avoid requesting pivs when the user has no session to do that yet.

```javascript
      if (B.get ('Data', 'csrf') && (! page || page === 'pics')) B.call (x, 'set', ['State', 'queryURL'], hash [1] || 'home');
```

This is as good a place as any to understand the flow of responders when this modification to `State.queryURL` is done, or, more in general, to understand how changes in the URL are reflected in the state and viceversa. The order of operations is the following:

```javascript
window.location.hash changes -> read hash -> set State.queryURL -> set State.query -> change State.query -> update queryURL -> update window.location.hash
```

This flow will be executed when 1) the app is loaded; 2) the user enters a new URL with a different hash; 3) another part of the app logic changes `window.location.hash`

You might have noticed that at the end of this flow, we set `window.location.hash`. Wouldn't this trigger an infinite loop? It will not, but only because `update queryURL` will only change `window.location.hash` if it doesn't already have the desired value. In the case where the flow starts with a change on the hash, all the upcoming changes will reflect what is already there in the hash.

We might be getting ahead of ourselves, but notice how this flows enables a change in `State.query` to do an abridged version of this sequence of operations, which skips everthing before but still updates `queryURL` and `window.location.hash`.

Finally, and after the operations above are executed, the responder will invoke `goto page`, passing `page` and `true` as extra arguments.

```javascript
      B.call (x, 'goto', 'page', page, true);
   }],
```

We now define `goto page`, the responder in charge of making sure that the user is in the right page (or perhaps, in the right *view*).

this is the main navigation responder, which decides whether a change in the hash should take the app to a new page. Before explaining the implementation, it is useful to understand the requirements of navigation in the application:
- We cannot go to views that don't exist.
- We can only show certain pages while being logged in, and certain pages only when being logged out.
- When requesting a logged in page when being logged out, the user should be redirected to the requested page after signup/login. We'll use `State.redirect` to store the required view after signup/login.
- When loading the app for the first time, we should notice whether the user wants to go to no view or the default view (which means the default view), or a valid view that requires login.
- Navigation comprises four cases: 1) initial load of the app; 2) change of hash (the user has decided to go to another view or has pasted a link on the URL bar with the app already opened); 3) signup/login; 4) logout.
   - The initial load can take you to the requested view if you're logged in, or to `login` otherwise (but remembering that choice). It should disregard non-existing views being requested.
   - The change of hash is equivalent to the initial load.
   - `signup/login` takes you to either the requested view (`State.redirect`) or the default logged in view.
   - `logout` takes you to `signup/login`.
- Implementation notes:
   - This responder is invoked directly by `read hash`, as well as by all auth responders. The initial load calls it through invoking `read hash`.
   - This responder exists as a gatekeeper to `State.page`, to prevent responders that are matched on a certain value of `State.page` being triggered if the user doesn't have access to a certain page. For example, the responders that perform queries in `pics` should not be triggered until the user is logged in.

This responder will take two arguments, `page` (the page where the user should go, assuming they have the right permissions) and `fromHash`, an argument that if enabled indicates that this invocation comes from the `read hash` responder.

Since this responder is also invoked by some buttons in some views, we need to distinguish those invocations from the ones from `read hash`, for reasons we'll see below.

```javascript
   ['goto', 'page', {id: 'goto page'}, function (x, page, fromHash) {
```

We define a `pages` object, containing a list of pages that are reachable when the user is either `logged` and `unlogged`.

```javascript
      var pages = {
         logged:   ['pics', 'upload', 'share', 'tags', 'import', 'account', 'upgrade'],
         unlogged: ['login', 'signup', 'recover', 'reset']
      }
```

If the requested page is not in the `pages` object, we default to the first page in the `logged` category (`pages`).

```javascript
      if (! inc (pages.logged, page) && ! inc (pages.unlogged, page)) page = pages.logged [0];
```

We determine if the user is `logged` by checking whether `Data.csrf` is defined.

```javascript
      var logged = B.get ('Data', 'csrf');
```

If the user is not logged and is requesting a page that requires to be logged, we `set State.redirect` to `page` and then instead go to the first unlogged page (`login`). We do this through a recursive call to the `goto page` responder. Notice there's a `return` clause just before the event call, which means that in this case no further actions will be performed on this invocation of the responder.

```javascript
      if (! logged && inc (pages.logged, page)) {
         B.call (x, 'set', ['State', 'redirect'], page);
         return B.call (x, 'goto', 'page', pages.unlogged [0]);
      }
```

If the user is logged and is requesting a page that belongs to a user not logged in, we redirect them to the first logged page (`pics`) with a recursive call to `goto page`. Notice there's a `return` clause before the event call just as we did in the previous code block, to prevent further actions in this invocation of the responder.

```javascript
      if (logged && inc (pages.unlogged, page)) return B.call (x, 'goto', 'page', pages.logged [0]);
```

If the user is logged and `State.redirect` is set, we invoke `rem` on it.

```javascript
      if (logged && B.get ('State', 'redirect')) B.call (x, 'rem', 'State', 'redirect');
```

If we're here, we will send the user to `page`.

We set `document.title` based on the `page` to which we are sending the user.

```javascript
      document.title = ['ac;pic', page].join (' - ');
```

If `page` is `'pics'`:

```javascript
      if (page === 'pics') {
```

If the event was not called with the `fromHash` parameters and `State.query` is not `'home'`, this means that we are going to the `pics` page and we need to show the home tags. To ensure this, we `set State.queryURL` and then we set `State.page` to `page`. In this case, we do not do anything else.

```javascript
         if (! fromHash && B.get ('State', 'queryURL') !== 'home') {
            B.call (x, 'set', ['State', 'queryURL'], 'home');
            return B.call (x, 'set', ['State', 'page'], page);
         }
```

Let's go back for a minute to the sequence of changes produced when the hash of the page changes:

```
window.location.hash changes -> read hash -> set State.queryURL -> set State.query -> change State.query -> update queryURL -> update window.location.hash
```

The modification to `State.queryURL` basically inserts itself on the third step of the sequence; all the following operations (setting `State.query`, updating `State.queryURL` and `window.location.hash` will happen through this change on `State.queryURL`.

Finally, if `page` is `pics` but the event was called from the `read hash` event or `State.queryURL` is already `'home'`, we redefine `page` to be the concatenation of `page` with a slash plus `State.queryURL`.

```javascript
         page = 'pics/' + B.get ('State', 'queryURL');
      }
```

We `set State.page` to `page`. If `page` now contains a slash plus `State.queryURL` (as it will if `page` is `'pics'`), we take care to remove that part of the string before setting that value into `State.page`.

```javascript
      B.call (x, 'set', ['State', 'page'], page.replace (/\/.+/, ''));
```


Finally, we update `window.location.hash` if it's not what it should be. This concludes the responder.

```javascript
      if (window.location.hash !== '#/' + page) window.location.hash = '#/' + page;
   }],
```

TODO: add annotated source code in between these two sections.

We now define the `pics` responders.

We start with `change State.page`. Unlike other `change` events, we do not set the `match` property to `B.changeResponder`, since we only care about changes to `State.page`, not those on `State` or on a nested value (`State.page` will never contain a nested value).

```javascript
   ['change', ['State', 'page'], {id: 'change State.page -> pics'}, function (x) {
```

This responder will only perform actions if the current page is `pics`, otherwise it will return. There will be other responders defined later on `change State.page` dedicated to the other main views.

```javascript
      if (B.get ('State', 'page') !== 'pics') return;
```

If `State.query.updateLimit` is older than 10 milliseconds, the responder will update it to the current date. This ensures that the current query is fresh enough when coming back from another view. The reason we allow for 10 milliseconds rather than checking for the present moment is that this number can sometimes be set by another responder which triggers further logic, and by the time we get to the invocation of the current responder, some milliseconds have elapsed; if, in this case, we still update `updateLimit`, we will trigger an extra change to `State.query` and thus an extra invocation to `query pivs`, which we want to avoid.

```javascript
      if (B.get ('State', 'query', 'updateLimit') < Date.now () - 10) B.call (x, 'set', ['State', 'query', 'updateLimit'], Date.now ());
```

Finally, we call `change State.selected`, which might be necessary to highlight the current selection. This concludes the responder.

```javascript
      B.call (x, 'change', ['State', 'selected']);
   }],
```

We define the responder for `change State.query`. This is one of the main responders of the application.

```javascript
   ['change', ['State', 'query'], {id: 'change State.query', match: B.changeResponder}, function (x, newValue, oldValue) {
```

If what changes is the `State` object itself, or `State.query.recentlyTagged|update`, we don't do anything else, since we want to ignore these changes. But if `State.query` is set, or if `State.query.tags|sort|home|fromDate|updateLimit` change, we will perform further actions.

```javascript
      if (x.path.length < 2 || inc (['recentlyTagged', 'update'], x.path [2])) return;
```

If either `State.query.tags` or `State.query.sort` or `State.query.home` changed, we will remove the fields `fromDate`, `update` and `updateLimit` from the query, since we deem the query to have changed and thus we need to clear out these fields. We will do without triggering any `change` events yet, since we don't want to call other events yet.

```javascript
      if (inc (['tags', 'sort', 'home'], x.path [2])) B.rem (['State', 'query'], 'fromDate', 'update', 'updateLimit');
```

If `State.query.updateLimit` is either `true` or `undefined`, we set it to the current time. It will be `undefined` if it was just removed by the line above; and it will be `true` if set to that value by two user interactions; `true` means "the present moment", so the result will be the same.

```javascript
      if (inc ([true, undefined], B.get ('State', 'query', 'updateLimit'))) B.set (['State', 'query', 'updateLimit'], Date.now ());
```

We now invoke `update queryURL`, passing a truthy extra argument if what changed is `State.query.fromDate`. We want that to be truthy in that case since we don't want the `update queryURL` responder to create further browser history entries each time this parameter is changed - this parameter changes very often on what the user perceives as the same query (same `tags` and `sort`), so it shouldn't create a new browser history entry.

```javascript
      B.call (x, 'update', 'queryURL', x.path [2] === 'fromDate');
```

If what changes in the query is the `fromDate` key, we write a mechanism that will prevent unnecessary calls to `query pivs`.

```javascript
      if (x.path [2] === 'fromDate') {
```

if the total pivs we have brought from the query is equal to the total pivs on the query itself, we don't query further pivs since there's nothing else to bring.

```javascript
         if (B.get ('Data', 'pivs').length === B.get ('Data', 'pivTotal')) return;
```

We will now determine whether we should load further pivs, based on chunk visibility.

```javascript
         var chunks = B.get ('State', 'chunks');
         if (chunks.length) {
            var lastVisibleChunkIndex;
```

We iterate the chunks and note the last visible chunk.

```javascript
            dale.go (chunks, function (chunk, k) {
               if (chunk.userVisible) lastVisibleChunkIndex = k;
            });
```


If last visible chunk is the last or the next-to-last last chunk, we load more pivs. Otherwise, we don't.

If we are scrolling backwards on the same query, we also don't have to perform a new query. But if the previous load gave us enough pivs, the last visible chunk check will loading more pivs. So there's no need for further logic to cover this case.

```javascript
            if (lastVisibleChunkIndex + 1 < chunks.length - 1) return;
         }
      }
```

If we're here, we will invoke `query pivs`. We pass an `options` parameter which will have the key `noScroll` set if either `updateLimit` changed, or if `fromDate` changed and there was a previous value on `fromDate`. This will prevent scrolling on both cases.

The first situation is when we want to get the latest list of pivs for a given query (which should not change the scroll position); the second one will happen when the `scroll` responder updates `updateLimit` (which should also not change the scroll position since that would create an infinite loop).

The case where `fromDate` changes but there was no previous value is the loading of a first query through a link that contains a `fromDate` parameter - in that case, we do want to programmatically set the scroll so we will not pass `noScroll`.

This concludes the responder.

```javascript
      B.call (x, 'query', 'pivs', {noScroll: x.path [2] === 'updateLimit' || x.path [2] === 'fromDate' && oldValue});
   }],
```

TODO: add annotated source code in between these two sections.

We now define the responder for `toggle tag`, which will add or remove a tag from `State.query.tags`.

This endpoint takes as extra arguments `tag` (the tag to be toggled) and `addOnly`, a flag that if present, will only add the tag if it's not present in `State.query.tags` and do nothing if it's already there.

```javascript
   ['toggle', 'tag', {id: 'toggle tag'}, function (x, tag, addOnly) {
```

If `tag` is already in `State.query.tags`, we will want to remove it.

```javascript
      if (inc (B.get ('State', 'query', 'tags'), tags)) {
```

If `addOnly` is set, we will not remove the tag from the query. In this case, there's nothing else to do. This flag will be enabled on the sidebar when pivs are selected; when the icon to select the tag is clicked, we want only to add the tag, never to remove it - and it is cumbersome to add a conditional for each tag to specify either a call to `toggle tag` or a no-op.

```javascript
         if (addOnly) return;
```

If the tag being removed is `'u::'` and there are entries in `State.query.recentlyTagged`, we will remove `State.query.recentlyTagged` mutely (without calling a `change` event). We do this mutely since we will modify later `State.query.tags` and thus we want to avoid two calls to `query pivs`.

```javascript
         if (tag === 'u::' && B.get ('State', 'query', 'recentlyTagged')) B.rem (['State', 'query'], 'recentlyTagged');
```

We create a list of new tags in the variable `resultingTags`. If the tag being removed is *not* a year tag, the list will merely be the existing list of tags minus the tag being removed; but if the tag being removed is a year tag, and there is a month tag in the query as well, that month tag will be removed too from the list.

```javascript
         var resultingTags = dale.fil (B.get ('State', 'query', 'tags'), function (existingTag) {
            if (! (existingTag === tag || (H.isYearTag (tag) && H.isMonthTag (existingTag)))) return existingTag;
         });
```

If there are no more tags on the list of tags and there currently is a selection, we remove the existing selection.

```javascript
         if (resultingTags.length === 0 && dale.keys (B.get ('State', 'selected')).length) B.call (x, 'rem', 'State', 'selected');
```

We update `State.query.tags` and do nothing else. This concludes the case where we are removing the tag from the list. This concludes the case for removing the tag from the list.

```javascript
         return B.call (x, 'set', ['State', 'query', 'tags'], resultingTags);
      }
```

If we are here, we will be adding the tag to the list.

If `State.query.home` is set, we will mutely set it to `false`. We do this mutely since we will change `State.query` below and we want to do this just once during the execution of this responder.

```javascript
      if (B.get ('State', 'query', 'home')) B.set (['State', 'query', 'home'], false);
```

If the user's onboarding flag (`Data.account.onboarding`) is set and `State.onboarding` is not `false` yet, we set it to `false`. This will hide the onboarding view.

```javascript
      if (B.get ('Data', 'account', 'onboarding') && B.get ('State', 'onboarding') !== false) B.call (x, 'set', ['State', 'onboarding'], false);
```

We will now set `State.query.tags` to a new list of tags, which will include the tag being added, minus some tags already in the query that might have to be removed to avoid unwanted combinations in the query.

```javascript
      B.call (x, 'set', ['State', 'query', 'tags'], dale.fil (B.get ('State', 'query', 'tags'), undefined, function (existingTag) {
```

If we are adding the tags Organized or To Organize, and its complement tag is already present, we remove the complement tag from the new list of tags.

```javascript
         if (existingTag === 'o::' && tag === 't::'     || existingTag === 't::'     && tag === 'o::') return;
```

If the untagged tag is present and we are adding a user tag, we remove the untagged tag; conversely, if we are adding the untagged tag, we remove all the normal tags from the list.

```javascript
         if (existingTag === 'u::' && H.isUserTag (tag) || H.isUserTag (existingTag) && tag === 'u::') return;
```

If we are adding a range tag, we remove all the existing date tags (month and year), as well as other range tags, from the list.

```javascript
         if ((H.isDateTag (existingTag) || H.isRangeTag (existingTag)) && H.isRangeTag (tag)) return;
```

If we're adding a month tag, we remove any other month tags from the list.

```javascript
         if (H.isMonthTag (existingTag) && H.isMonthTag (tag)) return;
```

Otherwise, we let the existing tag stand. Finally, we add the new `tag` to the list.

```javascript
         return existingTag;
      }).concat (tag));
```

Finally, if we are adding a user tag and `State.filter` is set, we remove it. This concludes the responder.

```javascript
      if (H.isUserTag (tag) && B.get ('State', 'filter')) B.call (x, 'rem', 'State', 'filter');
   }],
```

We now define the responder for `toggle hometag`, which will add or remove a tag from the list of home tags.

```javascript
   ['toggle', 'hometag', {id: 'toggle hometag'}, function (x, hometag) {
```

We start by noting the position of the tag in the list of hometags.

```javascript
      var index = B.get ('Data', 'hometags').indexOf (hometag);
```

If the position of the tag in `Data.hometags` is `-1`, then the tag should be added to the list since it's not there. Otherwise, we will remove it. Note we do this directly without triggering `change` events yet.

```javascript
      if (index > -1) B.rem (['Data', 'hometags'], index);
      else B.add (['Data', 'hometags'], hometag);;
```

We invoke `POST /hometags` passing `Data.hometags` inside the body. If there's an error, we merely report it through `snackbar` and do nothing else.

```javascript
      B.call (x, 'post', 'hometags', {}, {hometags: B.get ('Data', 'hometags')}, function (x, error, rs) {
         if (error) return B.call (x, 'snackbar', 'red', 'There was an error updating your home tags.');
```

If the operation was successful, we invoke `query tags` (which will also refresh the list of home tags) and we call a `change` event on `Data.hometags`. This `change` event is necessary since we already updated `Data.hometags` without triggering a view redraw; even when the list of tags gets updated, no `change` event will now be fired since `Data.hometags` is what it already should be. For that reason, we now need to update the view directly through this `change` event.

This concludes the responder.

```javascript
         B.call (x, 'query', 'tags');
         B.call (x, 'change', ['Data', 'hometags']);
      });
   }],
```

We now define `shift hometag`, a responder for changing the position of a tag within the list of home tags.

```javascript
   ['shift', 'hometag', {id: 'shift hometag'}, function (x, from, to) {
```

This responder takes two indexes, the first one that of the tag we are moving, the other one the index to which in which we want to insert that tag. We get the corresponding tags to those two indexes.

```javascript
      var fromtag = B.get ('Data', 'hometags', from);
      var totag   = B.get ('Data', 'hometags', to);
```

We now update `Data.hometags` in place, without calling `change` events.

```javascript
      B.set (['Data', 'hometags', from], totag);
      B.set (['Data', 'hometags', to], fromtag);
```

As with the previous responder, we invoke `POST /hometags` passing `Data.hometags` inside the body. If there's an error, we merely report it through `snackbar` and do nothing else.

```javascript
      B.call (x, 'post', 'hometags', {}, {hometags: B.get ('Data', 'hometags')}, function (x, error, rs) {
         if (error) return B.call (x, 'snackbar', 'red', 'There was an error updating your home tags.');
```

If the operation was successful, we invoke `query tags` (which will also refresh the list of home tags) and we call a `change` event on `Data.hometags`. This `change` event is necessary since we already updated `Data.hometags` without triggering a view redraw; even when the list of tags gets updated, no `change` event will now be fired since `Data.hometags` is what it already should be. For that reason, we now need to update the view directly through this `change` event.

This concludes the responder.

```javascript
         B.call (x, 'query', 'tags');
         B.call (x, 'change', ['Data', 'hometags']);
      });
   }],
```

TODO: add annotated source code in between these two sections.

We now define `tag pivs`, the responder that will be in charge of tagging or untagging pivs.

It takes two arguments besides the context: `tag`, the actual tag to be added/removed to the selected pivs; and `del`, a flag that indicates whether this is an untagging or not.

```javascript
   ['tag', 'pivs', function (x, tag, del) {
```

If no `tag` is sent, we don't do anything. This can only happen if the event is called from the input element for adding a new tag when there is nothing in the element.

```javascript
      if (! tag) return;
```

If we are untagging, we ask the user for confirmation. If the confirmation is not given, then we don't do anything else.

```javascript
      if (del && ! confirm ('Are you sure you want to remove the tag ' + tag + ' from all selected pictures?')) return;
```

If the user is trying to tag a tag that is neither a user tag nor an Organize/To Organize tag, we invoke `snackbar` and stop the operation.

```javascript
      if (! H.isUserTag (tag) && ! inc (['o::', 't::'], tag)) return B.call (x, 'snackbar', 'yellow', 'Sorry, you cannot use that tag.');
```

We place the ids of the pivs to be tagged/untagged into `ids`. We store `State.query` into `query` and the amount of pivs in the current query in `pivTotal`.

```javascript
      var ids = dale.keys (B.get ('State', 'selected')), query = B.get ('State', 'query'), pivTotal = B.get ('Data', 'pivTotal');
```

If tagging (and not untagging) and `'u::'` is in `State.query.tags`, it adds each of the `ids` to `State.query.recentlyTagged`, but not if they are already there. Note it does this without triggering a change event, since we don't want to invoke `query pivs` just yet.

```javascript
      if (! del && inc (query.tags, 'u::')) dale.go (ids, function (id) {
         if (! inc (query.recentlyTagged || [], id)) B.add (['State', 'query', 'recentlyTagged'], id);
      });
```

We invoke `post tag`.

```javascript
      B.call (x, 'post', 'tag', {}, {tag: tag, ids: ids, del: del}, function (x, error, rs) {
```

If there was an error, we invoke `snackbar` and do not do anything else.

```javascript
         if (error) return B.call (x, 'snackbar', 'red', 'There was an error ' + (del ? 'untagging' : 'tagging') + ' the picture(s).');
```

If this was a tagging operation (and we did not mark pivs as Organized or To Organize) and the user still has no home tags (`Data.hometags`), we invoke `toggle hometag` on this tag to add it to the home tags.

```javascript
         if (! del && H.isUserTag (tag) && B.get ('Data', 'hometags').length === 0) B.call (x, 'toggle', 'hometag', tag);
```

If we are untagging all of the pivs in the query, we remove the tag from the query - more precisely, from `State.query.tags`. We don't do anything else, since this will indirectly perform a call to `query pivs`.

```javascript
         if (del && ids.length === pivTotal) return B.call (x, 'rem', ['State', 'query', 'tags'], query.tags.indexOf (tag));
```

If this was not an untagging operation, we invoke `snackbar`; note we use a differenet message if the tag in question is Organized or To Organize.

```javascript
         if (! del & H.isUserTag (tag)) B.call (x, 'snackbar', 'green', 'Just tagged ' + ids.length + ' picture(s) with tag ' + tag + '.');
         else if (! del)                B.call (x, 'snackbar', 'green', 'Just marked ' + ids.length + ' picture(s) as ' + (tag === 'o::' ? 'Organized' : 'To Organize ') + '.');
```

Now for some delightful application logic. If we are marking pivs as Organized or To Organize, and the complement tag (To Organize if we are marking pivs as Organized, or Organized if we aer marking pivs as To Organize) is present in the query, we remove the complement tag from the query to avoid a ronin (empty) query. We won't do anything else, since this will indirectly invoke `query pivs`.

```javascript
         if (inc (['o::', 't::'], tag) && ids.length === pivTotal) {
            var complement = tag === 'o::' ? 't::' : 'o::';
            if (inc (query.tags, complement)) return B.call (x, 'rem', ['State', 'query', 'tags'], query.tags.indexOf (complement));
         }
```

If we're here, we invoke `query pivs` directly, to update the tag information on the sidebar and on the pivs themselves.

```javascript
         B.call (x, 'query', 'pivs');
```

If `tag` is equal to `State.newTag`, we remove `State.newTag` so that the input will be cleaned. This concludes the responder.

```javascript
         if (tag === B.get ('State', 'newTag')) B.call (x, 'rem', 'State', 'newTag');
      });
   }],
```

TODO: add annotated source code in between these two sections.

We now define the responder for `change State.queryURL`. This responder will make sure that whatever is contained on `State.queryURL` is reflected on `State.query`.

```javascript
   ['change', ['State', 'queryURL'], {id: 'change State.queryURL'}, function (x) {
      var queryURL = B.get ('State', 'queryURL');
```

If `queryURL` is `home`, it will initialize `State.query` to a query with no tags, sorted by `newest`, with `updateLimit` set to now and showing the `home` view. No further actions will be performed in this case.

```javascript
      if (queryURL === 'home') return B.call (x, 'set', ['State', 'query'], {tags: [], sort: 'newest', updateLimit: Date.now (), home: true});
```

If we're here, the query URL presumably contains a query. If so, we make sure to set `State.onboarding` to `false` since we don't want to show the onboarding view if we are loading a query. We do not check whether `Data.account.onboarding` is set (to avoid setting it unnecessarily if `Data.account.onboarding` is disabled) because this might be executed before the account information arrives form the server.

```javascript
      if (B.get ('State', 'onboarding') !== false) B.call (x, 'set', ['State', 'onboarding'], false);
```

We will wrap the rest of the logic in a `try/catch` block, since the decoding of the hash into a query object might fail if the user inputs an invalid URL.

```javascript
      try {
```

We [base64 decode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) `State.queryURL`, then [percent decode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) it and finally parse it as JSON. If this operation fails, we will go to the `catch` block further below.

```javascript
         var query = JSON.parse (decodeURIComponent (atob (B.get ('State', 'queryURL'))));
```

If we're here, we successfully decoded the `queryURL` into a `query` object. We save a copy of `State.query` in `oldValue` and also create a variable `changes` to mark whether we will perform changes to the object.

```javascript
         var changes, oldValue = teishi.copy (B.get ('State', 'query'));
```

We iterate the three keys from `State.query` that were previously stored in `State.queryURL`. If any of them is different from the corresponding key at `State.query`, we mark `changes` as `true` and we directly set the key on `State.query`. Note we do this without triggering `change` events, to avoid further responders being matched at this point.

```javascript
         dale.go (['tags', 'sort', 'fromDate'], function (k) {
            if (eq (query [k], B.get ('State', 'query', k))) return;
            changes = true;
            B.set (['State', 'query', k], query [k]);
         });
```

If there were changes, we also directly set `State.query.home` to `false` to leave the home view, and we finally call a `change` event on `State.query`, passing the new and old values of `State.query` as extra arguments so that we can have that information in the log.

```javascript
         if (changes) B.set (['State', 'query', 'home'], false);
         if (changes) B.call (x, 'change', ['State', 'query'], B.get ('State', 'query'), oldValue);
      }
```

If there was a decoding error, we catch it and report it through a call to `post error`. This concludes the responder.

```javascript
      catch (error) {
         B.call (x, 'post', 'error', {}, {error: 'Change queryURL error', queryURL: B.get ('State', 'queryURL')});
      }
   }],
```

We now define the responder for `update queryURL`. This responder is in charge of updating `State.queryURL` and `window.location.hash` when `State.query` changes.

```javascript
   ['update', 'queryURL', {id: 'update queryURL'}, function (x, dontAlterHistory) {
```

If `State.query.home` is truthy, we define `hash` to be `'home'`.

```javascript
      if (B.get ('State', 'query', 'home')) var hash = 'home';
```

Otherwise, we will construct a hash from three keys on `State.query`: `tags`, `sort` and `fromDate`. We will store these on a `query` object.

```javascript
         var query = dale.obj (B.get ('State', 'query'), function (v, k) {
            if (inc (['tags', 'sort', 'fromDate'], k)) return [k, v];
         });
```

While it would be fitting to add `State.query.recentlyTagged` as well, we don't do it to avoid potentially making the URL longer than 2k characters, which may not be supported on some browsers.

As for the fields `update`, `updateLimit` and `home`, we definitely don't want to store those on a URL since the first two should be refreshed when the user opens the interface from a saved link, while the last one is redundant since `hash` will be just `'home'` if we want to show the home view.

We construct the hash by first stringifying it, then percent encoding it and finally base64 encoding it. The base64 encoding is done for aesthetic purposes only (all those `%` in the URL sure look ugly).

```javascript
         var hash = btoa (encodeURIComponent (JSON.stringify (query)));
      }
```

We now have the desired hash. If the desired hash is the same as the one already on `window.location.hash` (or rather, the same one prepended by `#/pics`), there's nothing else to do.

```javascript
      if (window.location.hash === '#/pics/' + hash) return;
```

If we're here, we will update both `window.location.hash` and `State.queryURL`.

If the `dontAlterHistory` argument wasn't passed, we merely update `window.location.hash`. This will, in turn, update `State.queryURL`. In this case, there's nothing else to do.

```javascript
      if (! dontAlterHistory) return window.location.hash = '#/pics/' + hash;
```

If `dontAlterHistory` was passed (which will happen when `change State.query.fromDate` changes, we will update the hash by overwriting the last browser history entry, so this action doesn't create another history entry.

In this case, we will directly set `State.queryURL`. We do this without triggering a `change` event to avoid triggering unnecessarily the `change State.queryURL` responder - if we didn't prevent this, nothing bad would happen since `State.query` wouldn't change.

```javascript
      history.replaceState (undefined, undefined, '#/pics/' + hash);
      B.set (['State', 'queryURL'], hash);
```

This concludes the responder.

```javascript
   }],
```

TODO: add annotated source code to the end of the file.

### `server.js`

TODO: add annotated source code from the beginning of the file.

We define `POST /hometags`, an endpoint that will update the list of home tags for the user.

```javascript
   ['post', 'hometags', function (rq, rs) {
```

The `body` should be an object containing a `homekeys` key, which should be an array of strings.

```javascript
      var b = rq.body;

      if (stop (rs, [
         ['keys of body', dale.keys (b), ['hometags'], 'eachOf', teishi.test.equal],
         ['body.hometags', b.hometags, 'array'],
         ['body.hometags', b.hometags, 'string', 'each']
      ])) return;
```

We define a `multi` key which we'll use to determine whether the tag exists for the user. We will also collect the tags on a `seen` object, to detect duplicate tags in the array.

```javascript
      var multi = redis.multi (), seen = {};
```

We iterate the tags sent by the user. We put entries for them in `seen`; if any tag is not a user tag, we will note the tag and stop the process, returning a 400 error of the form `{error: 'tag', tag: INVALID TAG}`. For every tag, we will also check whether it exists.

```javascript
      var invalidTag = dale.stopNot (b.hometags, undefined, function (hometag) {
         seen [hometag] = true;
         if (! H.isUserTag (hometag)) return hometag;
         multi.exists ('tag:' + rq.user.username + ':' + hometag);
      });
      if (invalidTag) return reply (rs, 400, {error: 'tag', tag: invalidTag});
```

If there's less entries in `seen` than in `b.hometags`, there was at least one repeated tag. We reply with a 400 error.

```javascript
      if (dale.keys (seen).length < b.hometags.length) return reply (rs, 400, {error: 'repeated'});
```

We now check whether each tag exists. After getting them from redis, we iterate the list of results; if any of the tags does not exist, we reply with a 404 error.

```javascript
      astop (rs, [
         [mexec, multi],
         function (s) {
            var missingTag = dale.stopNot (s.last, undefined, function (exists, k) {
               if (! exists) return b.hometags [k];
            });
            if (missingTag) return reply (rs, 404, {tag: missingTag});
```

If we're here, the input is valid. We merely stringify `b.hometags` and store it in `hometags:USERNAME`. We reply with a 200 code. This concludes the responder.

```javascript
            Redis (s, 'set', 'hometags:' + rq.user.username, JSON.stringify (b.hometags));
         },
         [reply, rs, 200]
      ]);
   }],
```

TODO: add annotated source code in between these two sections.

We create an array `ytags` to store the year tags in the query.

```javascript
      var ytags = [];
```

We create an object `tags`, which will have each tag as a key, and as a value an array with one or more usernames. We iterate the tags of the query; for each of them, if it's not a year tag, we put it in an object `tags` with the value being an array with the username of the user. If it is a year tag, we simply append it to `ytags`.

```javascript
      var tags = dale.obj (b.tags, function (tag) {
         if (! H.isYear (tag)) return [tag, [rq.user.username]];
         ytags.push (tag);
      });
```

We start the query process, invoking `astop`. We first bring all the tags shared with the user.

```javascript
      astop (rs, [
         [Redis, 'smembers', 'shm:' + rq.user.username],
```

If the user sent no tags, we set a variable `allMode` to denote that we want all possible pivs.

```javascript
         function (s) {
            var allMode = b.tags.length === 0;
```

If we're in `allMode`, we create an entry for the `a::` tag inside `tags`, with the same shape of the entries already there.

```javascript
            if (allMode) tags ['a::'] = [rq.user.username];
```

We iterate the list of tags shared with the user, retrieved on the call to the database we just did.

```javascript
            dale.go (s.last, function (sharedTag) {
```

We clean up the shared tag, which is of the form `USERNAME:TAG`; to do this, we strip the tag of all the characters preceding the colon, plus the colon itself. Usernames cannot have colons because we forbid it, so there's no risk of a colon meaning something else than the separator between the username and the tag. We store the cleaned shared tag into a variable `tag`.

```javascript
               var tag = sharedTag.replace (/[^:]+:/, '');
```

If the tag is not already in `tags` and we're not in `allMode`, we ignore this tag. However, if we're in `allMode`, even though the user didn't specifically request for this tag, we will still consider it.

```javascript
               if (! tags [tag] && ! allMode) return;
```

If the entry for the tag does not exist yet in `tags` (which can only happen if we're in `allMode`), we create the entry.

```javascript
               if (! tags [tag]) tags [tag] = [];
```

We push the username of the shared tag to the entry for that tag. We extract the username by finding all the characters in the tag that are before the colon. This concludes our iteration of the shared tags.

```javascript
               tags [tag].push (sharedTag.match (/[^:]+/) [0]);
            });
```

By now, `tags` will be an object with each key as a tag, and each value as an array of one or more usernames, with the first one being the username of the user itself: `{KEY1: [USERNAME1, ...], ...}`. This gives us a list of all the tag + username combination that are relevant to the query.

We create two variables: `multi`, to hold the redis transaction; and `qid`, an id for the query we're about to perform. This `qid` key will hold a set of piv ids in redis for the purposes of the query.

```javascript
            var multi = redis.multi (), qid = 'query:' + uuid ();
```

If we have year tags, we bring the ids of all the pivs belonging to each of them and store their union in the query key.

```javascript
            if (ytags.length) multi.sunionstore (qid, dale.go (ytags, function (ytag) {
               return 'tag:' + rq.user.username + ':' + ytag;
            }));
```

We iterate the tags. For each tag, for each of its users, we store the ids of the corresponding pivs onto a key made by appending the tag to the query key.

```javascript
            dale.go (tags, function (users, tag) {
               multi.sunionstore (qid + ':' + tag, dale.go (users, function (user) {
                  return 'tag:' + user + ':' + tag;
               }));
            });
```

We compute the ids of all the pivs that match the query. This will be either the intersection of all the ids for each tag. If there are `ytags`, we also use the query key. In the case of `allMode`, we perform the *union* of all tags, since there might be shared tags for the user.

The year tags are queried separately from normal tags because 1) if more than one year tag is sent, we want the union (not the intersection) of their pivs; and 2) it's not possible to share a year tag with another user, so the querying is simpler.

```javascript
            multi [allMode ? 'sunion' : 'sinter'] (dale.go (tags, function (users, tag) {
               return qid + ':' + tag;
            }).concat (ytags.length ? qid : []));
```

We delete all the temporary sets of ids we created for the query.

```javascript
            multi.del (qid);
            dale.go (tags, function (users, tag) {
               multi.del (qid + ':' + tag);
            });
```

We run the transaction and move to the next step of the process.

```javascript
            mexec (s, multi);
         },
```

By now, we have a list of all the ids of the pivs matching the query. To access them, we look for a certain item returned by the last call to redis. This item will be at index N (where N is the number of `tags`) or N+1, depending on whether the query has `ytags` or not.

```javascript
         function (s) {
            s.pivs = s.last [(ytags.length ? 1 : 0) + dale.keys (tags).length];
```

We create another `multi` transaction to retrieve the information for all the pivs. We also create an object `ids`, which we'll review in a minute.

```javascript
            var multi = redis.multi (), ids = {};
```

We retrieve all the info for this piv. If `b.recentlyTagged` is passed, we also set an entry for this id into the `ids` object.

```javascript
            dale.go (s.pivs, function (id) {
               multi.hgetall ('piv:' + id);
               if (b.recentlyTagged) ids [id] = true;
            });
```

We iterate `b.recentlyTagged` (this will be a no-op if it's not defined) and store the result into `s.recentlyTagged`.

```javascript
            s.recentlyTagged = dale.fil (b.recentlyTagged, undefined, function (id) {
```

If the piv that is inside `b.recentlyTagged` is already covered by the query, we ignore it.

```javascript
               if (ids [id]) return;
```

Otherwise, we bring its information from the database and return its `id`, so that it will be contained in `s.recentlyTagged`; this last variable will be then an array with the list of the recently tagged pivs that are in excess of the query.

```javascript
               multi.hgetall ('piv:' + id);
               return id;
            });
```

We perform the call to redis to retrieve piv information and move to the next step.

```javascript
            mexec (s, multi);
         },
```

We iterate the pivs in `s.recentlyTagged`, which are those in `b.recentlyTagged` that are not already contained in the rest of the query. The goal is to prevent returning info from pivs for which the user shouldn't have access.

```javascript
         function (s) {
            var recentlyTagged = dale.fil (s.recentlyTagged, undefined, function (v, k) {
```

If there's no such piv or the piv doesn't belong to the user, it cannot be a recently tagged piv by the user (since the user cannot tag a piv that is not theirs). In this case, we ignore the piv. Otherwise, we return the actuali piv information.

```javascript
               if (! s.last [s.pivs.length + k] || s.last [s.pivs.length + k].owner !== rq.user.username) return;
               return s.last [s.pivs.length + k];
            });
```

We set `s.pivs` to hold the info of the pivs queried, ignoring those coming from `b.recentlyTagged`; we concatenate to it the pivs in `recentlyTagged`, which have been filtered both by existence and ownership. This is the set of pivs that will match the query.

Note that we filter out any `null` values, which can happen if some pivs returned by the query got deleted before getting their info but after the first part of the query was done.

```javascript
            s.pivs = dale.fil (s.last.slice (0, s.pivs.length).concat (recentlyTagged), null, function (piv) {return piv});
```

If `b.idsOnly` is `true`, we only return an array with the ids of all the matching pivs. Notice that we ignore `b.sort`, `b.from` and `b.to`.

```javascript
            if (b.idsOnly) return dale.go (s.pivs, function (piv) {return piv.id});
```

If there are no pivs, we return an object representing an empty query. The fields are `total`, `pivs` and `tags`.

```javascript
            if (s.pivs.length === 0) return reply (rs, 200, {total: 0, pivs: [], tags: []});
```
